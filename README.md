# IT work

### Interview Senior Program Manager 

Work that was conducted by the Senior IT Program Manager/Lead was across the ANZ Digital Security Capability Framework around  Asia Pacific (11 countries) responsible for delivering the major transformational elements of ANZ Digital strategy through a collection of Agile programs and projects. Projects were delivered using Agile software development in Prince2/MSP framework.
Digital Portfolio pertinent to transformational elements of ANZ Digital strategy through a collection of programs and projects. These included:

•	Online Foundation
•	Digital Protect
•	Multi-Channel Platform
•	Digital for Bankers
•	Digital Sales Remediation

 One of the biggest struggles that the IT Program Manager highlighted , was being able to educate  certain team members through the cultural shift when making the transition from the Waterfall framework to Agile. During this transition process the delivery capability of projects wasn't the best as he highlighted,  keeping team members focused long enough to deliver meaningful increment of work which was known as sprints was a challenge.    
 
 # IT Technologies
 
## Blockchain
### What is blockchain?
Blockchain is a distributed ledger that operates through a network of computers. Generally, when an entity that has access adds data to a blockchain it is visible to everyone on that network. Further, each person on the network is responsible for keeping the record of transactions up to date. 

### Analogy of Blockchain in Simple terms 
Before Google Docs, if you wanted to work  on a piece of writing with someone online you had to create a Microsoft Word document, send it to them, and then ask them to edit it. Then you had to wait until they made those changes, saved the document, and sent it back to you. Google Docs was able to revoltonarise that by making it possible for multiple people to view and edit a document at the same time.  Most databases today still work like Microsoft Word: Only one person can make changes at a time, locking everyone else out until they are done. Blockchain fixes that by instantly updating any changes for everyone to see. For banking, that means that any money transfers are simultaneously verified on both ends. Blockchain could also be used in the legal business or architecture planning - really any business where people need to collaborate on documents.



### Impact
If you’ve ever transferred money globally, you’ll know that it can take many days to arrive in the recipient’s account. It is evident that  the average bank transfer takes three days to be conducted. In part, this has to do with the way  financial systems operate. Specifically, the time is driven by the need for funds to flow through a number of banks and custodial services  before finally landing in their destination. The actual balances also need to be restored via a complex network of financial mediums. A blockchain could improve this process. 
 
### Daily world            
In regards to affecting us in our everyday life, products or lines of business that require a third party to control flows of information or act as a source of truth are ripe for disruption by blockchain technology. These types of business include:\


#### Loans
(eg., in a decentralised peer-to-peer environment using a token)

#### Insureance
(eg., using smart contracts that sit on a blockchain)

#### Escrow services
(eg., using a smart contract solution that executes when certain conditions are met)

#### Trade finance
(eg., taking the manual paper work used in this process and placing it on a blockchain to create a record that is visible to all participants — that would be, to some extent, tamper resistant)





## Robot
### What is robots ?
A robot which is a programmable machine designed by the human can execute one or more tasks by itself with high precision and speed. There are a variety of robots, including medical robots, military robots, and entertainment robots. Robots can do most work what humans do, even better than human. The robot is roughly divided into two parts. One of them is autonomous robots, human only need set a task or more. These autonomous robots will finish these tasks without the human. Another type is telerobotics. Telerobotics is entirely controlled by a human operator. The state of the art of robots is that the combination of robot and artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence is a computer system can do the tasks that humans need intelligence do. Artificial intelligence is intelligence exhibited by machines. Some of the main goals of AI are natural languages processing, learning and self-evolving, reasoning, and planning. The robots which combine artificial intelligence can have their own thoughts in the future. They even can do any kind of work. For example, they will be an excellent doctor to save people who face the disease. They can follow each surgical procedure precisely because they are a machine. Nanorobot also is a new technology for robots. It is a significant technology. Nanobots are robots that are microscopic in nature. It can Inject into the blood vessels of the human body for health checkups and disease treatment. Perform repair work on human organs, perform cosmetic surgery, remove harmful DNA from genes, or install normal DNA in genes to achieve therapeutic effects. The most important point is nanobot may threat cancer in the next three years.

### Impact
There are lots of impact of the development of robots. Some of these influences are positive. Firstly, every area can use the robot. Robots are better than people in a few areas. For example, robots are not affected by the mood, the physical condition, and the environment. They can perform the tasks that humans have set for them very well with high efficiency. In some danger work, that point is a considerable factor, like doctors. If doctors make mistakes during the surgery, it will cause patients to lose their life, but robots do not make mistakes in the most time. They are meticulous machines. Secondly, robots can reduce lots of human resources. They can do a variety of jobs which need lots of cheap workers. For instance, a lot of heavy industry factories need lots of cheap labor. The robot can replace them and can do more tasks and work. Finally, some jobs face very dangerous work condition. It will bring negative influence in works body health. The robot can finish the work for them. However, there also have some disadvantages for robots. The most important point is that the unemployment rate will increase sharply because the robot will replace totally in some area. Robots are much cheaper than people. Because people who are the boss of the factories only need buy these robots once. They do not need to pay them every month. It will lead to lots of workers lose their jobs. Another major factor is that people are afraid that robots will hurt humans when they have their own thoughts. There may exist some uncontrollable factors to make human under the danger. It is a big problem for robots. Therefore, robots are much useful for our society. They can finish humans set work for them very well and they can do things that humans can not do, but robots can never replace humans.

For me, I really like these robots. Because these robots can let our lives become coinvent and interested. In my daily life, artificial intelligence exists in every place. For example, I probably use artificial intelligence every day. I rely on GPS to find the best route. SIRI and Google also can understand our speech. Artificial intelligence can make people’s life easier, like a self-drive car. It is a type of robots. In my home, there are lots of robot’s products, including a sweeping robot, household robots, and some robots toy. My parents really like a sweeping robot. They do not need a clean floor every day since I buy a sweeping robot for them. Robots just like a dog or a cat. They can company your family. Some of my friends do not like robots. They think robots cannot like a real human and very expensive than other things. I only can say that robots like a tool or a toy. You can use it and play with them and the robot will be like a real person in the future.

                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         ### Clouds servers                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                         Cloud services are patterns of growth, use and interaction of internet-based related services, often involving the provision of dynamically scalable and often virtualized resources over the Internet. The cloud is a metaphor for the Internet. In the past, the cloud was often used to represent the telecommunication network in the picture, but later it was also used to represent the abstraction of the Internet and underlying infrastructure. Cloud services are services that are available through the network in demand, easily extend.This service can be IT and software, Internet related or other services. It means that computing power can also circulate as a commodity through the Internet. The public cloud is growing in popularity, Microsoft has well position and it has a strong distribution network and a large customer base. That's why cloud services will drive up margins. private cloud turn to more popular. For now, Cloud server is a WEB based service that provides elastic cloud technology that can adjust the configuration of cloud hosts and integrates the Iaas service of computing, storage and network resources and it also can independently provide computing, storage, online backup, hosting, bandwidth and other Internet infrastructure services. Servers do more than just websites. Computers can do almost anything they want.For instance download, you can download someone else's super server first and then download to your computer through the cloud server. In the cloud computing, You can use the cloud server to do the calculation for you, first all you have to do is upload information about what you need him to do, and then he will give you the most direct answer after processing, in the process that requires huge computation speed and calculation amount, you do not have to consider that and you can directly get the result. After three years, almost all companies will adopt cloud services. However, cloud services are not fully used. Due to security problems, cloud services may reveal privacy.The security of cloud services will be more important. Hybrid cloud will be preferred, To meet business needs, the future enterprise will choose the Hybrid cloud and make a lot of customization while retaining its internal solutions. Considering the control of data flow, internal deployment is a better choice for network security, so in the future, enterprises prefer private cloud + public cloud. The more cloud applications, the more vulnerable cloud security will become, with global information security spending of $86.4 billion in 2017 and expected to reach $93 billion in 2018. In the future, the cloud computing industry will expect more cybersecurity companies to come up with new cloud security measures. The appeal of sky computing.Sky computing connects multiple clouds together, a pattern that takes resources from multiple cloud service providers and brings them together to create large-scale distributed infrastructure. Many cloud deployments rely on clusters of computers (but are very different from the composition, architecture, purpose, and way of working) of the grid, and also incorporate features of autonomic computing and utility computing. It is multi-cloud. Multi-cloud is an emerging cloud computing usage pattern which refers to the use of more than one public cloud computing service. There are two types of cloud: one is to mix two or three types of cloud, such as the public and private hybrid use and the other is to use multiple cloud service providers. cloud computing is a reason of almost companies to adopt it.Because cloud computing is fast, massive, highly scalable, and extremely cheap.

### Impact
The emergence of cloud servers proves that the Internet is constantly upgrading and the widespread use of cloud servers also proves that the existence of the Internet is not simple data storage.Cloud is focused on the Internet products in the form of services, Internet software into service but on the enterprise "cloud platform", everything will become different, no longer need to buy expensive hardware, at the same time also no longer need to set up a huge IT department, you just need to buy cloud services to software enterprises. Cloud storage makes life easier for everyone and people don't need to buy usb anymore. they can also have the cloud service download it for you, and then you can download the data, which is much more convenient. Not only that, people can store their computer data in the cloud, and change computers can also download directly. Cloud services can also affect a company's security, and leaks of company secrets or patents may be common when cloud services become popular and It could be exposed to competitors or hackers. This kind of impact on the company is also huge. Data is stored outside the control of the enterprise and it is very difficult to recover important data in case of errors.

In my opinion, the cloud platform can be divided into the first storage for the purpose of storage for the purpose of cloud platform, such as the network disk and microdisk that I often use. There is one not only for the purpose of storing data, but also the operation of data such as cloud space. Cloud technology can provide me with convenient channels and space and I can use my own things in different network environments and computers to realize the most convenient cross-platform, which is equivalent to the enhanced mobile hard disk, as long as the network is available.But the corresponding security problem could be worrying, if my things stored in your computer, U disk may be more at ease, others can't see, but in the network cloud platforms, perhaps his worry, other people will see, because there is no in his own hands, if which day account been lost or stolen, and this problem will be huge. Such worries may be necessary. In my country, China's cyber security is very concerning. So cloud services don't affect me very much.


## Project Ideas

For the Project Idea , we decided to go with Andrews blockchain innovation idea , as it highlighted a potential idea that can effectively change the way we operate . 


## Project outline


The Technology of Blockchain to Financial services would allow entities in that field to reduce a range of issues located in the current ledger . In conjunction it would give the consumer the right to their identity as well as easy accessibility to their own financial records . The application of blockchain to the Financial services sector would help solve:

Manipulation of data – information that isn’t disclosed , with correct financial information of the customer
Time – save time for client and operator
Identity fraud – maintain consistency with financial records such numerous amount of credit cards, loans , super and etc
Cyber Security – No more passwords or client numbers
Increase in productivity – Easier and more streamline process for Bankers who complete credit applications, making there job easier.


### Aim of the project 
The aim is to develop a Sovereign ID system that unifies and streamlines the way documents and data are accessed within the Financial Services Industry

Using Blockchain Technology, we can generate a unique ID authentication process for a users login,  by unifying one login system for all financial entities that contains all financial records relevant to banks and other financial companies.         

### Current Approach
Client Number/Username and password requirement for authentication are used banks , superannuation entities and insurance. No real authentication safety

### Project APProach
The technology will allow Financial Services to verify their data that is backed by a universal authentication process which enhances the accuracy of data, the credibility of consumer transactions and the transparency and clarity of the market. For the user this helps eliminate the threat of data leaks that can occur from hacks and internal employees of a certain financial entity.

## Challenges to adoption

The potential challenges of blockchain can also include the positives that it provides. One main issue is of a privacy point of view. With an open ledger system it becomes difficult to ensure privacy of the customer data. Although this can be reduced in some way by the use of a private or permissioned blockchains with strong encryption. Before the general public will trust their personal data on a ledger like the blockchain there has to be some standards that are followed in order to maintain cybersecurity concerns.

Blockchain also faces regulatory uncertainty. Cause there is no central standard or organization that monitors and regulates blockchain protocol, it would take time to develop an agreed upon internationally accepted standard. These standards and organizations would help overcome the fear of ensuring security.



## Group Refction

## Andrew Assaf - 

During the three weeks completing this  report , we were faced with many hurdles . I learned that working as a group is not as easy as I thought . Our meetings went well as a group , in light of this I was able to understand that learning to delegate certain tasks to be completed within a certain time frame dont usually go to plan. It is evident that for me and Jim what could've been improved,  was our other group members efforts to complete tasks and to effectively communicate back to emails and messages that were sent to him consecutively . Through conducting my interview for the IT professional section , I was able to learn that different methodologies such as agile and waterfall are in place for reasons such as completion of tasks within a certain period of time as project and software development evolve through self organised teams . 

## Qingzhao Liu -

I think IT is a very easy subject at first. I realize IT is not as simple as my thoughts when I start this assignment. You not only need learn lots of knowledge and do some research but also know how to finish the assignment with the teamwork.  I recognize what I need to do for my ideal job. The most important of group assignment is you need have a plan and finish it on time. It very necessary because some of these assignment work need step by step. If you do not finish your parts, your teammate may not do the next step. It will waste lots of time. Therefore, I learned lots of things from work with Andrew and I really like to work as a group because you can know each other with other classmates.      

## Penghan Wu -
 
In my point of view, Group work is very difficult to allocate and it is impossible to divide everyone's work equally.There are only three people in our group, which means more work for us.Therefore, our team will communicate more frequently and team members will supervise each other and make our work quality better. So in this assignment, I learned how to work in groups and how the cloud works and the special skills that define my ideal job in the future. It force me to realize how important communication is and English is also important. Even after graduation, we often communicate with our colleagues or leaders.
