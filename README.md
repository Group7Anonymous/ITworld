# IT work

### Interview Senior Program Manager 

Work that was conducted by the Senior IT Program Manager/Lead was across the ANZ Digital Security Capability Framework around  Asia Pacific (11 countries) responsible for delivering the major transformational elements of ANZ Digital strategy through a collection of Agile programs and projects. Projects were delivered using Agile software development in Prince2/MSP framework.
Digital Portfolio pertinent to transformational elements of ANZ Digital strategy through a collection of programs and projects. These included:

•	Online Foundation
•	Digital Protect
•	Multi-Channel Platform
•	Digital for Bankers
•	Digital Sales Remediation

 One of the biggest struggles that the IT Program Manager highlighted , was being able to educate  certain team members through the cultural shift when making the transition from the Waterfall framework to Agile. During this transition process the delivery capability of projects wasn't the best as he highlighted,  keeping team members focused long enough to deliver meaningful increment of work which was known as sprints was a challenge.

## Blockchain
### What is blockchain?
Blockchain is a distributed ledger that operates through a network of computers. Generally, when an entity that has access adds data to a blockchain it is visible to everyone on that network. Further, each person on the network is responsible for keeping the record of transactions up to date. 

### Analogy of Blockchain in Simple terms 
Before Google Docs, if you wanted to work  on a piece of writing with someone online you had to create a Microsoft Word document, send it to them, and then ask them to edit it. Then you had to wait until they made those changes, saved the document, and sent it back to you. Google Docs was able to revoltonarise that by making it possible for multiple people to view and edit a document at the same time.  Most databases today still work like Microsoft Word: Only one person can make changes at a time, locking everyone else out until they are done. Blockchain fixes that by instantly updating any changes for everyone to see. For banking, that means that any money transfers are simultaneously verified on both ends. Blockchain could also be used in the legal business or architecture planning - really any business where people need to collaborate on documents.



### Impact
If you’ve ever transferred money globally, you’ll know that it can take many days to arrive in the recipient’s account. It is evident that  the average bank transfer takes three days to be conducted. In part, this has to do with the way  financial systems operate. Specifically, the time is driven by the need for funds to flow through a number of banks and custodial services  before finally landing in their destination. The actual balances also need to be restored via a complex network of financial mediums. A blockchain could improve this process. 
 
### Daily world            
In regards to affecting us in our everyday life, products or lines of business that require a third party to control flows of information or act as a source of truth are ripe for disruption by blockchain technology. These types of business include:
