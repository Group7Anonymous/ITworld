I am from Chengdu, Sichuan, China, this is a lovely city, the birthplace of China National Treasure, Panda. I am currently a freshman in IT major at RMIT University. Before that, I have never been exposed to IT majors, but I am very interested in it, especially software development and game design. The games I usually like to play are related to space design and exquisite quality. For some software, I also hope that I can make some suggestions to change and be adopted. So I especially want to learn relevant IT knowledge to implement my website design and production software. In addition, I am passionate about piano. I have been playing the piano for fifteen years, so this is also an indispensable part of my life.
Hobbies:

-Listening music (gentle, rap, light)
-Play the piano
-Watching videos of games and playing games of FPS
-Sleep

Ideal jobs:
My ideal job is a software engineer, mainly to complete software development and programming. Although this is difficult in the future, there are also many complicated procedures, and I will do my best to make progress. In addition, I should also practice more than just text learning. Currently my task is study my major seriously, and then go to some IT companies for internships and gradually gain experience.
